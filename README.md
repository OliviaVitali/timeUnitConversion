# timeUnitConversion
Allows user to convert between different units of time.

<h1>Menu<h1>
  User can select from a list of time units to convert from and to. The menu is as follows
Pick your starting unit then ending units: 
  <li>1 seconds</li>
  <li>2 minutes</li>
  <li>3 hours</li>
  <li>4 days</li>
  <li>5 weeks</li>
  <li>6 exit</li>
  
  The menu asks for the amount of time the user wants to convert.  We currently do not allow for negative numbers as time travel is banned for the sake of the plot.
  
  Next main function converts the user's input using the conversionFlowChart function.
  The conversionFlowChart function returns the value of time and exits the program.
  
  
  CURRENT TODO:
  foo function unnecessary and should be removed
  Create test units and do error checking
  Create error handling
  Loop the menu until the user is finished with the program.
  
  STRETCH GOALS:
  Include negative time
  Include a calender function
  Include a clock function
  Integrate Clock and Calender which allow a user to know how far into the future/past a date is from another date.
